                    <p>The edge router has a good set of features. On the first page in the 
                    interface
                    you can see simple usage graphs. This is also where you change ip 
                    adresses of 
                    the interfaces. In the top of the UI you can see uptime, CPU usage and 
                    RAM 
                    usage.
                    </p></br></br></br>

                    <p>
                        In the next tab you can set up static routes and configure OSPF.

                    <p>The edge router lite has a quite advanced firewall UI.
                    In addition to setting access based on ip address and port you can filter
                    based on port state. Under the hood the router uses iptables, which you 
                    can 
                    acces with the CLI.</p></br></br></br>

                    <p>The router can be very difficult to set up if you dont know what you 
                    are 
                    doing. One great example of that is the NAT. The image shows a simple
                    NAT configuration that works. You can choose to use the configuration 
                    wizard
                    to set up the router for you. But remember. It will <b>wipe all settings
                    </b> 
                    on the router.</p>

                    <p>The built-in DHCP-server in the router is easy to set up. You can 
                    easily
                    look up dhcp leases.</p>

                    <p>Dynamic dns is easy to set up on this router, but I think it would be 
                    nice 
                    to be able to add other providers in the gui. I think TomatoUSB's ddns 
                    client 
                    is doing this the right way.
                    <br><br>
                    I would think you can make your own ddns client update script through
                    <a href='http://vyos.net/wiki/Task_schedulertask'>Task Scheduler</a>.
                    I havent tried 
                    this myself though, but I think it would work.

                    <p>You can have multiple users on the router. I think this is a nice 
                    feature, 
                    but without the 
                    possibility to have difrent access rights per user, I dont see how this 
                    would 
                    help me very far. I dont 
                    wont to give out admin rights. The operator user-mode is read-only.</p>
                
                    <b>Verdict</b>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                    The router is fast, and I love the feel of the router. I would have loved 
                    the 
                    posibility to add custom 
                    ddns updates easily, and more advanced user management. It is Difficult 
                    to 
                    set up the first time, and i 
                    would not recomend it to anyone without prior experience with networking. 
                    You 
                    cant set up IPv6 DHCP-PD  
                    in the GUI, which is a really basic feature.<br><br>All over i would 
                    recomend 
                    it, but only if you know 
                    what you are doing and dont need built-in WIFI.</p>
